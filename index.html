              <b><img src="assets/img/quote_sign_left.png" alt=""></b> Hi. My name is Abdul-Halim, and I'll be turning 17 at the end of the year. I was born in Adelaide, South Australia, but by descent, I am half-Greek and half-Indonesian. I currently live in Western Australia, and am home-schooled. As far as past education goes, I haven't yet finished high-school, but through OUA, I have completed some undergraduate courses, namely, the fundamentals of; mathematics, physics, English, 3D modelling, and programming. In order to be eligible for a Bachelor of IT, I am currently taking an RMIT course called "Introduction to Information Technology" (...which is what this website happens to be an assignment for, but you already knew that). My hobbies include football (⚽) and basketball. I’ve been interested in technology, particularly the concept of programming, for a long time. Since I was around 7, I used to make games in PowerPoint. Later on (since around 11), I made games in Scratch, a block coding website. Mor			e recently (last few years) I learnt Python and made some things there. I also learnt some Java, and, quite recently indeed, I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS. <small><img src="assets/img/quote_sign_right.png" alt=""></small>

I completed my certificate III in digital media and information technology this year and this is when I started my new job. My education in IT has stemmed from a lifelong interest in Computers and technology. I’ve started my studies in the field of IT because I think it’s an ever growing and important industry that won’t be going away in the future. I like to play poker, mountain bike, go to the gym, online game. I came to RMIT because I have a full-time job and the convenience of being able to study single subjects online was ideal for me to try and slowly but surely get through all the subjects to hopefully finish and get a degree so I can earn more money in the long run. I expect to get a well-rounded knowledge of all aspects of the subject an		d find a specific field in the industry that may interest me more than others to pursue. Skills I would like to learn more about in this course would be an extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, Microsoft Windows, Business Analysis, Python, Git and the ability to technically support with a high understanding in a security sense. <small><img src="assets/img/quote_sign_right.png" alt=""></small>

The reason for me living in Sweden is because I hold dual citizenship (Swedish and Australian) and have moved several times between the two countries. I have always loved playing video games and some of my earliest memories are from when I was playing Mario on my Gameboy in the early 2000s. However, my interest in IT really started at my university in Sweden where I studied robotics, however; the program was split into roughly equal parts programming and electronics. So, while through studying the program I realized my interest in programming and the software aspect of IT, I also realized my lack of talent and general interest in electronics, so I decided to drop out of the program and peruse programming in Australia. Most of my experience in IT also stems from the 2 years I spent studying 		robotics. <small><img src="assets/img/quote_sign_right.png" alt=""></small>

Besides working towards my academic goals and achievements, I love to crochet in my spare time. I’m fascinated by Moore’s law and the exponential growth of technology. I grew up in an exciting era for technology innovation and have obsessed with computers since childhood. I wanted to be a part of making exciting changes to the future using technology. Solving technical problems is an important aspect of computer science and is something I find incredibly satisfying.

I completed my High School through UK British studies O/A levels on June 3rd 2021. Talking about my hobbies, I love reading and bullet journaling in my free time, one of my advanced professions is in watercolor painting; it is said to be one of the most difficult types of paintings but I find it really enjoyable as high skill is required. The reason i chose IT was because of my interest that had been built over the past years, speaking of which, information security analyst is my main cause of attraction in IT, seeing how IT has grown to be the main backend for almost everything.

These scheduled meetings were conducted twice a week via video conference. MS Teams was also used to centralise all messaging between team members and all meeting communications. This tool was used to facilitate the production and maintenance of the group artifacts that were collaboratively constructed. This included formatted data, reports, images, links, and any word documents. Word documents that were shared via MS Teams, were created, and allowed each team member to contribute their input towards the main content. The written content was then formatted into a website and PDF documents for the final submission. To see the MS Teams information, click this link.</p>

The Git repository audit trail is not an accurate reflection of the work contributed by the team members. This is due to the fact that GitHub was only used during the final stages of completion of the group assessment. The primary use of this tool was to collaborate on the website construction and all other aspects of this assignment, including majority of the written content contributions are not recorded in the GitHub audit log as the group members found the use of MS Teams, Microsoft Word, and Notepad to be more efficient for completing those tasks.

            <p class="section-description">The group members ideal jobs and career plans are quite different, thought everybody does want to work within IT, which sector and IT, the reasoning behind it, interest etc are vastly different from one another. Maleeha and Abdul do share a common way of thinking, which is that they both state that as of right now they can not give a concrete answer as to their dream job as they lack experience in the field. Though they are the only ones who have stated this in assignments 1 and 2, all group members (besides Jarrod) can relate to this quite strongly and it has affected our individual ideal job and career plan. Another thing that ties our ideal jobs and career plans together is education, specifically that we all would need a bare minimum of a bachelor’s degree within IT (such as computer science, information technology etc), although after this is where our career paths take different turns.<br><br>Getting certificates within IT is a common trait for both Jarrod and Maleeha, though the actual certificates differ as per their writing, there is still a high chance that they may need to end up getting the same certificate since they both are interested in cyber security. Tung’s dream job involved working with cloud service and networking, he mentions the same thing as Maleeha and Jarrod that cyber security knowledge is a necessity for this job, meaning that Tung will most likely also get the same/similar certificate(s) as Jarrod and Maleeha. John and Kylies dream job are the same, though Kylie specifically mentioned working at a big tech company, they both wish to pursue a career as a software engineer. Their reasoning for this does vary, they share a common goal and will most likely choose a similar path to achieve this dream job.</p>
