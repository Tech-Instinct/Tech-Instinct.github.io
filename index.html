            <h2>Group Processes</h2>
	    <p class="about-text">
               Good communication is a vital component of a successful group project. Our group has communicated thus far using primarily Microsoft Teams, and, to a limited extent, email. The group has held two meetings per week on Microsoft Teams discussing the project report and its surrounding details. More information that is omitted in the meeting may be discussed by posts in the General channel of the Teams group, or member specific information can be exchanged via the Chat feature. Project failure is commonly caused by group miscommunication, and to ensure that every member is aware to be present during information briefings, we established a set time and date for the two weekly meetings. If a group member happens to be unavailable for the meeting, they ideally let the group know beforehand, allowing the other members to consider rescheduling. We also decided to have a 10-minute delay in the beginning of meetings if waiting for an absent group member to attend the meeting, and to begin thereafter if th		e member had still not appeared. Members may also view the recording of the meeting later to brief themselves of any information or tasks.</p>

            <p class="service-description">The primary purpose of using this tool was to record the formal progress team meetings. These scheduled meetings were conducted twice a week via video conference. MS Teams was also used to centralise all messaging between team members and all meeting communications. This tool was used to facilitate the production and maintenance of the group artifacts that were collaboratively constructed. This included formatted data, reports, images, links, and any word documents. Word documents that were shared via MS Teams, were created, and allowed each team member to contribute their input towards the main content. The written content was then formatted into a website and PDF documents for the final submission. To see the MS Teams information, click this link.</p>

            <p class="service-description">GitHub repository was set up with the intended purpose of using a Git to facilitate the production and maintenance of the Tech Instinct website. The Git repository audit trail is not an accurate reflection of the work contributed by the team members. This is due to the fact that GitHub was only used during the final stages of completion of the group assessment. The primary use of this tool was to collaborate on the website construction and all other aspects of this assignment, including majority of the written content contributions are not recorded in the GitHub audit log as the group members found the use of MS Teams, Microsoft Word, and Notepad to be more efficient for completing those tasks.

              <b><img src="assets/img/quote_sign_left.png" alt=""></b> Hi. My name is Abdul-Halim, and I'll be turning 17 at the end of the year. I was born in Adelaide, South Australia, but by descent, I am half-Greek and half-Indonesian. I currently live in Western Australia, and am home-schooled. As far as past education goes, I haven't yet finished high-school, but through OUA, I have completed some undergraduate courses, namely, the fundamentals of; mathematics, physics, English, 3D modelling, and programming. In order to be eligible for a Bachelor of IT, I am currently taking an RMIT course called "Introduction to Information Technology" (...which is what this website happens to be an assignment for, but you already knew that). My hobbies include football (⚽) and basketball. I’ve been interested in technology, particularly the concept of programming, for a long time. Since I was around 7, I used to make games in PowerPoint. Later on (since around 11), I made games in Scratch, a block coding website. Mor			e recently (last few years) I learnt Python and made some things there. I also learnt some Java, and, quite recently indeed, I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS. <small><img src="assets/img/quote_sign_right.png" alt=""></small>

I completed my certificate III in digital media and information technology this year and this is when I started my new job. My education in IT has stemmed from a lifelong interest in Computers and technology. I’ve started my studies in the field of IT because I think it’s an ever growing and important industry that won’t be going away in the future. I like to play poker, mountain bike, go to the gym, online game. I came to RMIT because I have a full-time job and the convenience of being able to study single subjects online was ideal for me to try and slowly but surely get through all the subjects to hopefully finish and get a degree so I can earn more money in the long run. I expect to get a well-rounded knowledge of all aspects of the subject an		d find a specific field in the industry that may interest me more than others to pursue. Skills I would like to learn more about in this course would be an extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, Microsoft Windows, Business Analysis, Python, Git and the ability to technically support with a high understanding in a security sense. <small><img src="assets/img/quote_sign_right.png" alt=""></small>

The reason for me living in Sweden is because I hold dual citizenship (Swedish and Australian) and have moved several times between the two countries. I have always loved playing video games and some of my earliest memories are from when I was playing Mario on my Gameboy in the early 2000s. However, my interest in IT really started at my university in Sweden where I studied robotics, however; the program was split into roughly equal parts programming and electronics. So, while through studying the program I realized my interest in programming and the software aspect of IT, I also realized my lack of talent and general interest in electronics, so I decided to drop out of the program and peruse programming in Australia. Most of my experience in IT also stems from the 2 years I spent studying 		robotics. <small><img src="assets/img/quote_sign_right.png" alt=""></small>

Besides working towards my academic goals and achievements, I love to crochet in my spare time. I’m fascinated by Moore’s law and the exponential growth of technology. I grew up in an exciting era for technology innovation and have obsessed with computers since childhood. I wanted to be a part of making exciting changes to the future using technology. Solving technical problems is an important aspect of computer science and is something I find incredibly satisfying.

I completed my High School through UK British studies O/A levels on June 3rd 2021. Talking about my hobbies, I love reading and bullet journaling in my free time, one of my advanced professions is in watercolor painting; it is said to be one of the most difficult types of paintings but I find it really enjoyable as high skill is required. The reason i chose IT was because of my interest that had been built over the past years, speaking of which, information security analyst is my main cause of attraction in IT, seeing how IT has grown to be the main backend for almost everything. Though I don’t have any such experience in Information Technology I look forward on learning through RMIT. <small><img src="assets/img/quote_sign_right.png" alt=""></small>
