		<div style: text-align="left"><br><b>Abdul-Halim</b><br>I think a good decision the group made was to have set meeting days each week; that helped ensure everyone was aware when to turn up for their next briefing. During the later stages, the group began to broke down what needed to be done, which was very helpful. Overall, I am grateful to have had this group of students to work with, as they were kind and supportive, which lightened my struggle with anxiety as much as possible.<br>
		I’ve been thinking about the reason why we’ve ended up being quite so late, and I’ve arrived at the conclusion that it is probably my fault. I stepped away from leading and stayed more silent, and didn’t really take on extra or more complex tasks. I guess I was burnt-out from pushing myself through the first Group Assignment. The group probably had a harder time without the direction and organizing they expected, and that may be why we’re later than anticipated? I expected from the start I would be bad at group work and was worried about letting the group down. So I am disappointed in myself and apologetic.<br>
		Despite the stress it brought, I can be thankful for the experience I’ve gained from group work, it seems to have reduced my social anxiety, even in public (unless I am just beginning to grow out of it, perhaps?).<br><br><br>
		<b>Jarrod Murphy</b><br>My experience working with this group has been mostly positive, everyone has tried their best to get the work done and handed in as promptly as possible. Doing group assessment work over the internet can be quite challenging and I think it’s important to have the ability to overcome that challenge to continue down this style of learning. This was why I was surprised that we did so well in our first assessment as a group, this gave me confidence going into the final assessment as a group because of everyone's hard work in the previous assessment. Organisation in meetings has been the biggest issue with us in my opinion but that’s just part of the challenges that come with doing this work online especially when there's different time zones and daily life with work etc. I think everyone is at the same stage in which we are competent with computers and this area of study which has been a little challenging in some areas of our project idea in figuring out exactly how we will achieve our goal		s of completing the assessment but I'm confident in our team at getting it done.<br><br><br>
		<b>John Norberg</b><br>The experience I have had working in this group has been mostly positive. It has been a fun experience seeing everybody agree to do x amount of work on y thing, then checking the document/website by the set due date and everybody has done exactly what they have said. Watching the website being built and documents filled out by others while I am off doing my own part of the project is really fun and motivating. A big part of why I have enjoyed the group work has been that our group is really easy going, as in everybody listens to each other's ideas and gives everybody a chance to say their piece, as long as you have the courage to speak your mind the group will definitely listen and either agree and give constructive feedback as to why they don’t. The biggest problem our group has had however is definitely our organizational skills, scheduling meetings has proven difficult. Though that is most likely due to our lack of experience working in groups online with people from many 
		different time-zones.<br><br><br>
		<b>Kylie Copeland</b><br>This team was successful in achieving our objective which makes it difficult for me to pinpoint any improvements regarding performance. This has been a rewarding, challenging and enjoyable experience for me, personally. I thoroughly enjoyed most aspects of working as a group and collaborating with my team to work in these assignments. I don’t feel that the outcome would have differed by much had we scheduled our meetings differently. Meeting remotely via video conference is something that is new me and probably to most of us, however, I was amazed that we were all able to meet as a group as often as we did. I was really impressed by that. I felt that our system of deciding who would be Chairperson and who would be Secretary (taking minutes/writing agenda) was very effective. Something that I would probably do differently, if I were to work collaboratively on a team project, is changing the procedures involved in the use of an agenda for each meeting. This may have improved the 
		structure of our meetings and we may have used that time more efficiently.<br><br><br>
		<b>Maleeha Yasir</b><br>Considering everything, every member of the team played their role evenly. The group overall knew what we had to do, how to compromise in a team, everything fell into place smoothly even after facing a few obstacles towards the end.<br>
		I personally believe the thing that could improve is our daily sitting on Microsoft teams, to contribute to a team you need to always have set times where anyone is free to discuss anything with you regarding any part of the assignment. <br>
		The surprising thing that I encountered was that everyone knew how to contribute in the team, they all knew how to manage things, whereas i thought everyone will take things a bit confusing at the beginning and struggle. <br>
		I have learned that working in groups isn’t all that easy, nor too complicated. If you want to do teamwork you need to have top-notch communication skills, you have to be upfront, and most importantly you need to be able to collaborate.  <br>
		At first most of the team members struggles with GitHub, but after getting the hang of it, GitHub allows you to go back to the previous code and update it with any changes, you can commit those changes as a new branch, or directly to the main branch.<br><br><br>
		<b>Ngo Khanh Tung</b><br>As a second-year student at RMIT, working as a group member is not too unfamiliar while dealing with school assignments. Despite that, there are still far more things that I have learnt after spending time with Team 9, ‘Tech Instinct’.<br>
		One of that is trust. For the first time I have the feeling of workload management, we share a same big assignment, a same project and yet everyone has their own jobs, and the work was done quite well eventually.<br>
		Participating and managing meetings ever week is also an achievement when we could in turn be the chair and doing the documentation instead of one or two persons doing all the work.<br>
		As time pasts, we gradually could not only be more casual and open to each other but also keep our professionalism. I am still a shy, introverted member but I finally saw some progresses and found my place inside a team.<br>
		I am truly grateful to work with Team 9 and hope to meet our team members and work with each other again in the future.</p>

            <p class="section-description">Good communication is a vital component of a successful group project. Our group has communicated thus far using primarily Microsoft Teams, and, to a limited extent, email. The group has held two meetings per week on Microsoft Teams discussing the project report and its surrounding details. More information that is omitted in the meeting may be discussed by posts in the General channel of the Teams group, or member specific information can be exchanged via the Chat feature. Project failure is commonly caused by group miscommunication, and to ensure that every member is aware to be present during information briefings, we established a set time and date for the two weekly meetings. If a group member happens to be unavailable for the meeting, they ideally let the group know beforehand, allowing the other members to consider rescheduling. We also decided to have a 10-minute delay in the beginning of meetings if waiting for an absent group member to attend the meeting, and to begin thereafter if the member had still not appeared. Members may also view the recording of the meeting later to brief themselves of any information or tasks.</p>
