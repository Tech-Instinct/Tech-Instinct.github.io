            <p class="section-description">The number of vehicles has been increasing throughout the world and with this, sadly, so has the number of accidents (both fatal and non-fatal) involving vehicles.<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> This number of vehicle-related accidents can be safely said to be on the incline as per a report presented by the CDC. This reports key finding was that the number of traffic deaths has increased to 11.1 people per 100 000 people (from 2010-2019). There have also been cases where the family of the victim(s) and/or the emergency response team have not had the correct information in time, leading to preventable deaths/injuries and heart-broken family members.<br><br> To decrease the average number of traffic related deaths throughout the world our project idea is to make use of smartphones. By allowing the smartphone to detect dangerous situations involving vehicles, such as traffic accidents, theft, fires etc, and sending correct relevant information to the appropriate authorities we hope to make the roads much safer than they are now.</p>

            <p class="section-description">Failing to provide timely lifesaving treatment to an injured person can be the leading cause of a road accident fatality. There is a clear need for a tool to help effectively call for assistance and to alert local emergency services while providing them with the precise location of the accident. This can be done by automating a request for help when the motion of a crash has been detected. The purpose of the following report is to document the production of a service that can address the need of a computerised technology that improves the response time of emergency services and their arrival to the scene of an accident. This product is a possible solution or improvement to the delayed arrival of emergency services, by providing the emergency dispatch with prompt, and precise details of the road accident.</p>

            <p class="section-description">The motivation behind this product idea is to minimize the casualty/injury rate of vehicle related accidents and to properly allow emergency responders to save people from said accidents more affectively. The way this idea works is by making use of android phones with a computerized framework which is used to identify vehicle-related accidents and alert the relevant authorities. The reason for why this framework will help minimize serious consequences of an accident is by decreasing the time between the accident occurring and the emergency responders finding out about it and gathering the relevant information. This is because the framework can immediately after being activated send the current location of the accident to the authorities withing the closest vicinity of the accident site, thus decreasing response time exponentially. By doing this emergency responders can help the victim(s) quicker and in turn, save more people.</p>

            <p class="section-description">The premise of the WreckWatch is somewhat similar to the BlackBox design in planes. A BlackBox record flight information such as speed, position, and audio and can be salvages in a crash to find what happened, and what went wrong. WreckWatch is implemented in cars, and will record the travel data to ensure that there isn’t an accident or crash. When the WreckWatch detects a crash, it alerts the emergency response units to the location with information, ideally ensuring faster response time and higher survival chances. Another product with a similar purpose function is Google’s new phone, Google Pixel, with its Personal Safety feature which detects a crash and contacts the emergency response systems. Hopefully, WreckWatch can provide safety, at a price a thousand times cheaper than the $999 of the Pixel.</p>

            <p class="section-description">According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, nearly two-thirds of all hospitalised injuries are accounted for by on road vehicle traffic crashes.<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup><br><br> 
<i>“Road traffic injuries kill more than 1.25 million people every year and are the number one cause of death among 15–29 year olds. Over 50 million people are also injured in non-fatal crashes every year, causing an enormous burden of disability.”</i> (World Health Organisation)<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup><br><br> 
Esurance reported that 77% of drivers have been involved in at least one road accident and out of the 10 million road accidents that occur every year, 3 of every thousand are fatalities.<sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup><br><br>
The process of requesting immediate assistance after being involved in a serious accident, has proven to be difficult. Currently, there are mobile applications that promise to assist the user to request for help from emergency services. However, there is a need for a simple, user-friendly smartphone application that can automate the processes involved with requesting for help and also provide quick and accurate details of the precise location an accident may have occurred. Using the in-built technology of a smartphone, it is possible to detect that a crash has happened and trigger these processes automatically. It is possible that those involved in an accident are unable to move or are unconscious and therefore, unable to call for help. By using a straightforward approach, this product development is a possible solution to this problem and can allow for the user to increase their chance of survival and decrease the severity of an injuries.
In the event of a serious road accident, there are critical factors that can impact the severity of injuries that may have occurred. Taking every precaution to ensure that emergency services are contacted immediately could potentially save lives. The quicker emergency medical services are notified, the sooner they can arrive on the scene which means a greater the chance of survival. An effective post-crash response can significantly improve the outcome of someone who has been injured and needs immediate medical assistance.<br><br>Tech Instinct is in the development stage of a new product, WreckWatch. WreckWatch is a mobile phone application that assists road users to alert emergency services and contacts in the unfortunate event of a road accident. This automated service will use GPS to provide an accurate location and the in-built sensors/accelerometer in a smartphone to detect a crash. The intent of this product development is assist the user to promptly and accurately request for immediate assistance.<br><br>By allowing smartphones to detect dangerous situations involving vehicles, and sending correct relevant information to the appropriate authorities, we hope to make the roads much safer than they are now.</p>

            <div class="section-title-divider"></div>
            <p class="section-description">We will create a framework that utilizes Android smartphones and the OBD-II in vehicles. When this framework recognizes that the user has been involved in an accident it will alert client specific contacts via SMS. This SMS will contain relevant information, such as accident location, allowing for the appropriate personal people to be quickly notified and able to act accordingly. Along with the SMS, the framework will also make a call to the nearest emergency response authorities. However, for this framework to work the standard that Europe and the US has for their OBD-II needs to be met. <br><br> 
We could also create a framework that utilizes the accelerometer, GPS, and amplifier to detect accidents or connect a cable between the airbags system and telematics system to allow the Android phone to detect if the airbags have been deployed. However, with these methods the process after would be the same. After confirming that there has been an accident the framework would then notify a net server and send a SMS to the users preferred emergency contact(s), this also means that emergency response agencies need to have access to said webserver. <br><br>
The current framework emergency response agencies have access to now utilizes the same sensors and equipment we would; however, one of the biggest drawbacks to their current framework is that they need to check the web server for accident notices, it is not automatic. In other words, there is no framework for personal responders which tracks a victim's location. <br><br>
We would make use of a framework called WreckWatch which includes information from the accelerometer and acoustic information to from the receiver to identify an accident. The framework will, as previously stated, alert the relevant authorities, and can also send a voice message to the emergency responders closest to the accident site. However, this framework has a high chance of sending a false positive, which would be incredibly counterproductive for what we are trying to achieve. A false positive could be triggered by a framework error, dropping of the smartphone etc. To counteract this, we looked at pre-existing frameworks and will base our framework on these different ones to minimize the risk of a false positive emergency call as much as physically possible. <br><br>
Smartphones are getting more technologically advanced every day, and the amount of smartphone users increases along with it. Because of this, we will centre this framework around smartphones to identify accidents and alert the relevant authorities. Smartphones also have the bonus of being most popular among teenagers and young adults, which coincidentally also happen to be the age groups most likely to be involved in a vehicle related accident. Therefore, by leveraging that smartphone are already integrated in the age group with the highest risk factor, we would minimize the hassle of having to allow for a large adjustment period among users of this framework. <br><br>
As previously stated, smartphone technology has gotten astronomically better since their original release, meaning that it is far easier and more effective to leverage this technology to both identify accidents and automatically call for help. As an example, with even an older model smartphone, the iPhone 4; this phone incorporates a GPS framework which allows it to know the exact location of itself if it has a connection, an accelerometer, a microphone etc. However, now the technology in smartphones far surpasses that of the iPhone 4 with sensory information, meaning that it will be a lot more efficient for us to make use of this to identify an accident, alert authorities and further minimize the chance of getting a false positive. WIFI and the general reception area has gotten overall better and continues to get better, meaning that, even in remote areas, users can make use of this framework to get the help required in the event of an accident.<br><br>
WreckWatch is a project we’re going to develop that will not only save lives but will also have a big impact on the people of this country. The lives of people are our number one priority, the fact that this project will not only save lives but will also reduce accidents. Sensors will be used which will individually be connected to each car outside and inside, these sensors will play the role of notifying any unusual encounter, for this, multiple types of sensors will be used; pressure sensors which will be used to detect the pressure of a car in collision, The pressure of an automobile in a collision is detected using a pressure sensor. This component also collects continuous pressure data and raises an accident alert when the pressure surpasses a 350-pound-per-square-inch threshold. The pressure sensor is utilized to improve the system's accuracy and lower the likelihood of incorrect accident detection and reporting.  Smartphone Accelerometer sensor: If an accident occurs, the impact sensor generates signals that cause a flag bit in the micrometer to be set, alerting the microcontroller to the fact that an accident has occurred. The accelerometer sensors ADXL 335 from analogue devices were employed to detect the impact. It is a comprehensive 3 axis 3g accelerometer that is tiny, thin, and low power. It can detect gravity's static acceleration as well as dynamic acceleration caused by motion, shock, or vibration in tilt sensing applications. On-Board Sensors: It can accurately detect road accidents using an OBU that consists of an accelerometer and a gyroscope, as well as identify an accident event using the Global Positioning System (GPS). It has the ability to collect photographs from inside a car using a high-definition camera module, and then attach the recorded images/data to the other information transmitted to the destination. Using a vehicular ad hoc network, the entire message is forwarded to the edge node. Edge Gateway: These are the entities in the control room who are located in all of the regions. It is in charge of receiving an accident notice and subsequently processing the data gathered. Another duty of Edge Gateway is to use face detection methods to determine the number of victims and the individual involved in the accidents. It also analyses the data received from the network's nodes before informing the hospital so that the ambulance may be dispatched as soon as possible. It also has the capability of temporarily storing data until it is safely received by the cloud server.<br><br>
The overall contribution of the proposed system is divided into two main procedures: <br>
1. The first procedure deals with the automatic accident detection mechanism that also provides a module to record the necessary information. Additionally, the system based on the implemented Testbed deals with the following three novel aspects: 
(a) The detection of an accident with the help of sensed information through appropriate sensors where an algorithm has been developed to gather and monitor the required information. Based on the sensed information, it performs the logical computation to detect the accident. Once it is detected, it generates an alert message. This article includes the details of data processing of the accident detection module in a practical manner. Additionally, the contribution is presented through a flow chart of the proposed system to detect an accident correctly and in a timely manner. <br>
(b) The second module is used to identify the location of the accident and medical service nearby. It then notifies the hospital not only about the condition of the person but also about the severity of the event based on the damage. Moreover, it stores useful information about the incident for future use.<br>
(c) The third part deals with the hospital module, which not only sends the ambulance to the incident location on emergency alert, but also gathers the passenger’s status like injuries, deaths along with medical proof of alcohol and personal details like name, age, and the Electronics 2019, 8, 896 5 of 28 number of passengers, etc. This information is then sent back to another module for future use.<br><br>
For this we’ll put together an Android and IOS app where all the information will have input and output, the app will require a full login with each and every detail from name to blood group. This app will automatically be connected to every hospital in the area, Hospitals will also be made to implement this software where it will have direct communication with our app. The outcome so far; we have all our algorithms laid out and planned as well as the flowcharts as needed. The negative sides have also been listed out alongside some positive aspects; we came across some risks which have also been noted down and taken care of. Testing part is also cleared nonetheless the roles have all been assigned to each individual with tools and technologies. For more detailed information, view Timeframes, you’ll get a better idea of our format and outcomes so far.<br>
The following points may prove invaluable in reducing the number of casualties and injuries drastically, caused by road accidents: <br>
• Providing medical help to victims of road accidents in a timely manner. <br>
• Notification about the precise situation to the first responders.<br>
 • Lack of a permanent database, holding all appropriate documents and records, which can be examined as and when necessary.<br><br>
Section 1. Keeping false positives at bay to assess if an accident has happened, vehicle-based accident detection systems monitor a network of sensors linked to the vehicle. An instance of strong acceleration/deceleration owing to a big change in vehicle velocity over a short period of time is one major signal of a collision. These acceleration occurrences are difficult to achieve if a vehicle is not actively being driven, as an unattended automobile is unlikely to just roll away from a parked spot. However, because cellphones are portable, it's feasible that the phone will experience acceleration events that the user would not. A phone, for example, may fall from a height of 6 feet. It's critical to identify and reduce false positives in a smartphone-based accident detection software since it notifies emergency services and may deploy police/rescue teams. Because of smartphone mobility, it's difficult to programmatically distinguish between a real automobile accident and a dropped pocketbook or a fall on a hard surface. The failure to effectively recognize and reject false positives, on the other hand, might render smartphone-based accident detection apps ineffective by spending emergency response resources on fake event reports. Section?? discusses how we use devi to overcome this problem. However, the inability to effectively recognize and reject false positives might render smartphone-based accident detection apps ineffective by spending emergency responder resources on event reports that aren't really accidents. Section?? outlines how we solve this problem by filtering out probable false positives using device usage context (such as speed).<br><br>
<b>Solution approach</b><br>
This section presents a "WreckWatch" prototype smartphone-based client/server application we created to solve the issues raised in Section 1. WreckWatch works in a similar way as an accident/event data recorder in that it records the route, speed, and acceleration forces on a vehicle prior to and during an accident. It may also deliver preset text and/or audio messages to emergency contacts, aggregate photographs and video supplied by onlookers at the scene of an accident, and inform emergency personnel of accidents. <br>
<b> The WreckWatch Architecture </b><br>
WreckWatch is separated into two main components—the WreckWatch server and the WreckWatch client. The WreckWatch client is developed using Google Android. It acts as a mobile sensor, relays accident information to the server via standard HTTP post operations, and provides an interface that allows third-party observers to contribute accident report data<br>
The Android client for WreckWatch is going to be built in Java and based on Android 1.5 with Google APIs. It is made up of many Androids app Activities1 for mapping, testing, and image uploading. Background services monitor smart-phone sensors like the GPS receiver and accelerometers for accidents. The polling rate can be changed at compile time to fit the demands of the user and to ensure that the appropriate power consumption characteristics are achieved. To identify emergency contacts, the WreckWatch client can acquire data from phone databases (such as an address book). The Android client communicates with the server using conventional HTTP post operations.<br>
The Spring Framework and Java/MySQL were used to create the WreckWatch server. It gives emergency responders, family, and friends with data aggregation and a communication channel. It also allows customers to provide accident characteristics (such as acceleration, route, and speed) and provides numerous interfaces for viewing this information, including a Google Map and XML/JSON web services.<br>
The WreckWatch server updates a Google Map with location, route, and severity information as it becomes available, to assist emergency responders and other cars attempting to navigate the roadways around the accident. This map is produced with AJAX and HTML and is accessible through HTTP with a typical web browser. The rest of this section describes WreckWatch's formal accident detection model and strategy to reducing false positives, as well as elements of the WreckWatch client/server programmer that assist first responder situational awareness.<br>
The period between an accident and its detection can be cut in half. In-vehicle accident detection and notification systems, such as OnStar, are effective in reducing the time it takes for first responders to get on the site. However, these technologies are costly and not accessible in every car. Smartphones may be used to detect accidents indirectly through their inbuilt sensors, such as accelerometers, to help boost the use of automatic accident detection and notification systems. However, there are a number of obstacles to overcome, including the possibility of false positives due to lost phones. Because of the enormous number of "phantom" (accidental) calls to 911, it's critical to lower the false positive rate of smartphone accident detection. Accident detection systems that are resistant to false positives can be constructed using a combination of context data, such as when a user is inside a vehicle, sensor data, such as accelerometer and auditory information, and intelligent sensor data filtering. Air bag deployment, for example, is only activated when acceleration exceeds 60 G's. We gained the following lessons while building and testing WreckWatch, a prototype accident detection and notification system.<br>
• Accidents cause extraordinary forces to be applied to a phone that are unlikely to occur when it is dropped. The forces produced during an automobile accident are enormous, and they are extremely unlikely to occur in any other situation save a high-speed collision. As a result, these events are easier to recognize and describe. Furthermore, false positives are less common when the accident detection technique is combined with contextual information to establish when the user is in a car.<br>
• Smartphones have the potential to provide new situational awareness capabilities. Uninjured spectators and motorists can act as citizen scientists by providing several streams of speech and imagery data from the accident scene. This information can help first responders determine the severity of the event, the number of victims, and the need for medical attention. Smartphones can also offer information about the victims' identities and automatically notify emergency contacts, such as family members.<br>
• App stores on smartphones significantly reduce the cost and complexity of software maintenance. On a smartphone, the built-in application upgrading methods and communication channels allow you to distribute updates to hundreds of millions of customers and roll back if the installation fails. This functionality has shown to be very useful in maintaining and improving software in accident detection and notification systems.<br>
• It's probable that smartphones won't be able to detect all incidents. Because of the filters used to prevent false positives, it's possible that a low-speed "fender-bender" will be unnoticed by the app. To accommodate these types of collisions, further work needs to be done to improve the filtering systems. WreckWatch's filtering algorithm, in particular, could be improved to discern whether the user is in a car or not using historical data. Users may take similar routes to work, for example, and WreckWatch may learn where stops or speed restrictions are typical by analyzing trends (For example, if a person normally goes through an area at 40 mph but periodically comes to a halt, signaling a possible traffic jam). Similarly, WreckWatch might use recognized intersections to identify and forecast possible pauses or download traffic data to estimate the location of traffic jams caused by long-duration speed reductions.<br>
• Acoustic data alone is insufficient for detecting traffic collisions. Our empirical findings reveal that signal clipping occurs above 140dBs in various smartphone microphones and signal processing infrastructure. This clipping makes it difficult to distinguish noises like shouting from air bag deployment. This constraint may be overcome able, but it will necessitate considerable effort.<br>

            <p class="section-description">At Wreckwatch our goals are to make a technology that helps provide emergency services and people a more direct way to inform the required services needed to help in a very distressing situation, this cannot be done without testing our product to ensure this can be delivered. One question that needs to be answered or tested by WreckWatch is which part of the globe this product will be most effective in. By using statistics on car accidents and where most injuries and deaths occur in the world would provide a good indicator of where WreckWatch would be most suitable to implement the product and where it would have the greatest impact to help emergency services and in effect help save lives that may be in danger from these accidents. Social media would be used to take in surveys from users to see if this is a product that the public would use, this could also be useful to find out the best areas of people would be most interested in using the product. The most crucial part of this product working is to figure out if using an OBDII sensor with an application or IoS device in a crash scenario will be effective at relaying the response via SMS to emergency services. This can be done by setting up a standard crash test scenario with dummies and the use of the WreckWatch system installed into the vehicle to make sure that everything works accordingly without any bugs as to not have false positives and being counterproductive in what WreckWatch is trying to achieve.</p>

            <p class="section-description">One of the biggest risks we are taking with this project is, ironically, taking on this project. Because all members of this group are new to IT, this project is a huge risk considering our lack of experience and proficiency. This is because we will not have a baseline for a timeframe or experience with planning, group work, proper testing, the tools involved, revering from a failed test etc. So, with such little experience and knowledge, taking a project this grand with such consequences is a big risk in in of itself.<br><br>
	    Another big risk is the responsibility that this product would put on us. It is intended to save lives and/or reduce injuries in vehicle related accidents. If it were to fail to do so, that would way heavily on the mental health of us as a group. This is a huge psychological risk we would we be taking by making this project a reality, it must work since you do not get do overs in real life. If the product fails, the responsibility would be on us as the creators, which could be extremely detrimental to our health.</p>
