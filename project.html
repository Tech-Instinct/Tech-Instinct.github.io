            <p class="section-description">The number of vehicles has been increasing throughout the world and with this, sadly, so has the number of accidents (both fatal and non-fatal) involving vehicles. [1] This number of vehicle-related accidents can be safely said to be on the incline as per a report presented by the CDC. This reports key finding was that the number of traffic deaths has increased to 11.1 people per 100 000 people (from 2010-2019). There have also been cases where the family of the victim(s) and/or the emergency response team have not had the correct information in time, leading to preventable deaths/injuries and heart-broken family members. To decrease the average number of traffic related deaths throughout the world our project idea is to make use of smartphones. By allowing the smartphone to detect dangerous situations involving vehicles, such as traffic accidents, theft, fires etc, and sending correct relevant information to the appropriate authorities we hope to make the roads much safer than they are now.</p>

            <p class="section-description">Failing to provide timely lifesaving treatment to an injured person can be the leading cause of a road accident fatality. There is a clear need for a tool to help effectively call for assistance and to alert local emergency services while providing them with the precise location of the accident. This can be done by automating a request for help when the motion of a crash has been detected. The purpose of the following report is to document the production of a service that can address the need of a computerised technology that improves the response time of emergency services and their arrival to the scene of an accident. This product is a possible solution or improvement to the delayed arrival of emergency services, by providing the emergency dispatch with prompt, and precise details of the road accident.</p>

            <p class="section-description">According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, nearly two-thirds of all hospitalised injuries are accounted for by on road vehicle traffic crashes.1 
“Road traffic injuries kill more than 1.25 million people every year and are the number one cause of death among 15–29 year olds. Over 50 million people are also injured in non-fatal crashes every year, causing an enormous burden of disability.” (World Health Organisation)2 
Esurance reported that 77% of drivers have been involved in at least one road accident and out of the 10 million road accidents that occur every year, 3 of every thousand are fatalities.3 
The process of requesting immediate assistance after being involved in a serious accident, has proven to be difficult. Currently, there are mobile applications that promise to assist the user to request for help from emergency services. However, there is a need for a simple, user-friendly smartphone application that can automate the processes involved with requesting for help and also provide quick and accurate details of the precise location an accident may have occurred. Using the in-built technology of a smartphone, it is possible to detect that a crash has happened and trigger these processes automatically. It is possible that those involved in an accident are unable to move or are unconscious and therefore, unable to call for help. By using a straightforward approach, this product development is a possible solution to this problem and can allow for the user to increase their chance of survival and decrease the severity of an injuries.</p>

            <p class="section-description">To implement an effective and efficient system for automated connectivity to emergency contacts and request the most immediate assistance in the event of a car accident.<br><br>The motivation behind this product idea is to minimize the casualty/injury rate of vehicle related accidents and to properly allow emergency responders to save people from said accidents more affectively. The way this idea works is by making use of android phones with a computerized framework which is used to identify vehicle-related accidents and alert the relevant authorities. The reason for why this framework will help minimize serious consequences of an accident is by decreasing the time between the accident occurring and the emergency responders finding out about it and gathering the relevant information. This is because the framework can immediately after being activated send the current location of the accident to the authorities withing the closest vicinity of the accident site, thus decreasing response time exponentially. By doing this emergency responders can help the victim(s) quicker and in turn, save more people.<br><br>
In the event of a serious road accident, there are critical factors that can impact the severity of injuries that may have occurred. Taking every precaution to ensure that emergency services are contacted immediately could potentially save lives. The quicker emergency medical services are notified, the sooner they can arrive on the scene which means a greater the chance of survival. An effective post-crash response can significantly improve the outcome of someone who has been injured and needs immediate medical assistance.<br><br>Tech Instinct is in the development stage of a new product, WreckWatch. WreckWatch is a mobile phone application that assists road users to alert emergency services and contacts in the unfortunate event of a road accident. This automated service will use GPS to provide an accurate location and the in-built sensors/accelerometer in a smartphone to detect a crash. The intent of this product development is assist the user to promptly and accurately request for immediate assistance.</p>

            <p class="section-description">We will create a framework that utilizes Android smartphones and the OBD-II in vehicles. When this framework recognizes that the user has been involved in an accident it will alert client specific contacts via SMS. This SMS will contain relevant information, such as accident location, allowing for the appropriate personal people to be quickly notified and able to act accordingly. Along with the SMS, the framework will also make a call to the nearest emergency response authorities. However, for this framework to work the standard that Europe and the US has for their OBD-II needs to be met. <br><br> 
We could also create a framework that utilizes the accelerometer, GPS, and amplifier to detect accidents or connect a cable between the airbags system and telematics system to allow the Android phone to detect if the airbags have been deployed. However, with these methods the process after would be the same. After confirming that there has been an accident the framework would then notify a net server and send a SMS to the users preferred emergency contact(s), this also means that emergency response agencies need to have access to said webserver. <br><br>
The current framework emergency response agencies have access to now utilizes the same sensors and equipment we would; however, one of the biggest drawbacks to their current framework is that they need to check the web server for accident notices, it is not automatic. In other words, there is no framework for personal responders which tracks a victim's location. <br><br>
We would make use of a framework called WreckWatch which includes information from the accelerometer and acoustic information to from the receiver to identify an accident. The framework will, as previously stated, alert the relevant authorities, and can also send a voice message to the emergency responders closest to the accident site. However, this framework has a high chance of sending a false positive, which would be incredibly counterproductive for what we are trying to achieve. A false positive could be triggered by a framework error, dropping of the smartphone etc. To counteract this, we looked at pre-existing frameworks and will base our framework on these different ones to minimize the risk of a false positive emergency call as much as physically possible. <br><br>
Smartphones are getting more technologically advanced every day, and the amount of smartphone users increases along with it. Because of this, we will centre this framework around smartphones to identify accidents and alert the relevant authorities. Smartphones also have the bonus of being most popular among teenagers and young adults, which coincidentally also happen to be the age groups most likely to be involved in a vehicle related accident. Therefore, by leveraging that smartphone are already integrated in the age group with the highest risk factor, we would minimize the hassle of having to allow for a large adjustment period among users of this framework. <br><br>
As previously stated, smartphone technology has gotten astronomically better since their original release, meaning that it is far easier and more effective to leverage this technology to both identify accidents and automatically call for help. As an example, with even an older model smartphone, the iPhone 4; this phone incorporates a GPS framework which allows it to know the exact location of itself if it has a connection, an accelerometer, a microphone etc. However, now the technology in smartphones far surpasses that of the iPhone 4 with sensory information, meaning that it will be a lot more efficient for us to make use of this to identify an accident, alert authorities and further minimize the chance of getting a false positive. WIFI and the general reception area has gotten overall better and continues to get better, meaning that, even in remote areas, users can make use of this framework to get the help required in the event of an accident.<br><br></p>

            <p class="section-description">At Wreckwatch our goals are to make a technology that helps provide emergency services and people a more direct way to inform the required services needed to help in a very distressing situation, this cannot be done without testing our product to ensure this can be delivered. One question that needs to be answered or tested by WreckWatch is which part of the globe this product will be most effective in. By using statistics on car accidents and where most injuries and deaths occur in the world would provide a good indicator of where WreckWatch would be most suitable to implement the product and where it would have the greatest impact to help emergency services and in effect help save lives that may be in danger from these accidents. Social media would be used to take in surveys from users to see if this is a product that the public would use and this could be also be useful to find out the best areas of people would be most interested in using the product. The most crucial part of this product working is to figure out if using an OBDII sensor with an application or IoS device in a crash scenario will be effective at relaying the response via SMS to emergency services. This can be done by setting up a standard crash test scenario with dummies and the use of the WreckWatch system installed into the vehicle to make sure that everything works accordingly without any bugs as to not have false positives and being counterproductive in what WreckWatch is trying to achieve.</p>

            <p class="section-description">One of the biggest risks we are taking with this project is, ironically, taking on this project. Because all members of this group are new to IT, this project is a huge risk considering our lack of experience and proficiency. This is because we will not have a baseline for a timeframe or experience with planning, group work, proper testing, the tools involved, revering from a failed test etc. So, with such little experience and knowledge, taking a project this grand with such consequences is a big risk in in of itself.<br><br>
	    Another big risk is the responsibility that this product would put on us. It is intended to save lives and/or reduce injuries in vehicle related accidents. If it were to fail to do so, that would way heavily on the mental health of us as a group. This is a huge psychological risk we would we be taking by making this project a reality, it must work since you do not get do overs in real life. If the product fails, the responsibility would be on us as the creators, which could be extremely detrimental to our health.</p>
